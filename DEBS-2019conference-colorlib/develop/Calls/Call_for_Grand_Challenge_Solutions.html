                        <p class="justifyAlignment mb-0">The DEBS Grand Challenge is a series of competitions, that
                            started
                            in 2010, in which both
                            academics and professionals compete with the goal of building faster and more
                            accurate
                            distributed and event-based system. Every year, the DEBS Grand Challenge
                            participants have a
                            chance to explore a new data set and a new problem and can compare their results
                            based on
                            the common evaluation criteria. The winners of the challenge are announced during
                            the
                            conference.

                            The 2019 DEBS Grand Challenge focuses on the application of machine learning to
                            LiDAR data.
                            The goal of the challenge is to perform classification of objects in different
                            scenes
                            surveyed by the LiDAR. The applications of LIDAR and object detection go well beyond
                            autonomous vehicles and are suitable for use in agriculture, waterway maintenance
                            and flood
                            prevention, and construction. The 2019 Grand Challenge evaluation platform is
                            provided by
                            the

                            project,

                            H2020 research and innovation action program under grant agreement number 688227.

                                    aspects: (1)
                                    processing speed and
                                    (2) quality of results. We capture both aspects with multiple measures, each
                                    resulting
                                    in an

                                    The first step is to pre-register your submission in the <a

                                    organizers. At this step, it is sufficient to submit an interims title for your
                                    work.

                                    Solutions to the challenge, once developed, must be submitted to the evaluation
                                    platform
                                    (details will be provided later) in order to get it benchmarked in the challenge.

                                    evaluation platform provides detailed feedback on performance and allows to update

                                    solution in an iterative process. A solution can be continuously improved until the
                                    challenge closing date. Evaluation results of the last submitted solution will be
                                    used
                                    for

                                    The last step is to upload a short paper (minimum 2 pages, maximum 6 pages)
                                    describing
                                    the
