                        <p class="justifyAlignment">Computing Systems are undergoing a multitude of interesting changes:
                            from the platforms (cloud, appliances) to the workloads, data types, and operations (big
                            data, machine learning). Many of these changes are driven or being tackled through
                            innovation in hardware even to the point of having fully specialized designs for particular
                            applications. In this talk I will review some of the most important changes happening in
                            hardware and discuss how they affect system design as well as the opportunities they create.
                            I will focus on data processing with an emphasis on streams and event based systems but also
                            discuss applications in other areas. I will also briefly discuss how these trends are likely
                            to result in a very different form of IT, and consequently of Computer Science, from the one
                            we know today.</p>

                            In the last four years, stream processing has gone from niche to mainstream, with real-time
                            data processing systems gaining traction in not only fast-moving startups, but also their
                            more skeptical and cautious enterprise brethren. In light of such pervasive adoption, is it
                            safe to say we’ve we finally reached the point where stream processing is a solved
                            commodity? Are we done and ready to move on to the next big thing?</p>
                        <p class="justifyAlignment">
                            In this talk, I will argue that the answer to those questions is conclusively "no": stream
                            processing as a field of research is alive and well. In fact, as streaming systems evolve to
                            look more and more alike, the need for active exploration of new ideas is all the more
                            pressing. And though streaming systems are more capable and robust than ever, they remain in
                            many ways difficult to use, difficult to maintain, and difficult to understand. But we can
                            change that.</p>
                        <p class="justifyAlignment">
                            I don’t claim to have all the answers; no one does. But I do have a few ideas of where we
                            can start. And by sharing my thoughts on some of the more interesting open problems in
                            stream processing, and encouraging others to share theirs, I’m hoping that we as a research
                            community can work together to help move the needle just a little bit further.</p>

                            Online event processing are abound ranging from web and mobile applications to data
                            processing. Such event processing applications often require the ability to ingest, store,
                            dispatch and process events. Until now, supporting all of these needs has required different
                            systems for each task -- stream processing engines, messaging queuing middleware, and
                            pub/sub messaging systems. This has led to the unnecessary complexity for the development of
                            such applications and operations leading to increased barrier to adoption in the
                            enterprises.</p>

                            In this keynote, Karthik will outline the need to unify these capabilities in a single

                            Pulsar was designed to address this need with an elegant architecture. Apache Pulsar is a
                            next generation distributed pub-sub system that was originally developed and deployed at
                            Yahoo and running in production in more than 100+ companies. Karthik will explain how the
                            architecture and design of Pulsar provides the flexibility to support developers and
                            applications needing any combination of queuing, messaging, streaming and lightweight
                            compute for events. Furthermore, he will provide real life use cases how Apache Pulsar is
                            used for event processing ranging from data processing tasks to web processing
                            applications.</p>

                            Event Stream Processing is a popular paradigm for building robust and performant systems in
                            many different domains, from IoT to fraud detection to high-frequency trading. Because of
                            the wide range of scenarios and requirements, it is difficult to conceptualize a unified
                            programming model that would be equally applicable to all of them. Another tough challenge
                            is how to build streaming systems with cardinalities of topics ranging from hundreds to
                            billions while delivering good performance and scalability.</p>

                            In this session Sergey Bykov will talk about the journey of building Orleans Streams that
                            originated in gaming and monitoring scenarios, and quickly expanded beyond them. He will
                            cover the programming model of virtual streams that emerged as a natural extension of the
                            virtual actor model of Orleans, the architecture of the underlying runtime system, the
                            compromises and hard choices made in the process. Sergey will share the lessons learned from
                            the experience of running the system in production, and future ideas and opportunities that
                            remain to be explored.</p>

                            Sergey Bykov joined Microsoft in 2001 and worked in several product groups, from BizTalk and
                            Host Integration Server to embedded operating systems for Point of Sale terminals to Bing.
                            The mediocre state of developer tools for cloud services and distributed systems at the time
                            inspired him to join Microsoft Research to start the Orleans project, in order to
                            qualitatively improve developer productivity in that area.</p>
                        <p class="justifyAlignment">
                            The Orleans Framework implemented a radically new approach to building scalable distributed
                            applications and cloud services via a simple and intuitive programming model. Orleans has
                            been used for years to power blockbuster games like Halo, Gears of War, and Age of Empires,
                            within Skype, Azure, and a number of other Microsoft product groups, as well as for IoT,
                            financial modeling, and many other domains by Microsoft customers. Clones of Orleans created
                            for JVM, Go, and Erlang only confirm success of the Orleans model.</p>
                        <p class="justifyAlignment">
                            Orleans has become one of the most successful Open Source .NET projects, with a vibrant
                            world-wide community of contributors, and is a showcase of the New Microsoft. Sergey
                            continues leading Orleans along with several other innovative projects within the Microsoft

                            In a few short years, the Function-as-a-Service paradigm has revolutionized how we think
                            about distributed event processing. Within seconds, developers can deploy and run
                            event-driven functions in the cloud that scale on demand. CIOs love the high availability
                            and zero administration. CFOs love the fine-grained, pay-as-you-go pricing model.</p>

                            Most FaaS platforms today are biased toward (if not restricted to) simple functions,
                            functions that only run for a short while, use limited CPU and memory, and process
                            relatively small amounts of data. In this talk, we will get a closer look at FaaS platforms
                            (using Apache OpenWhisk as our exemplar) to understand these trade-offs.</p>
                        <p class="justifyAlignment">
                            Functions are not applications. To build compelling FaaS applications we need to compose
                            functions. In this talk, we will compare approaches to function composition both from a
                            developer and from a system’s perspective. We will show how composition can dramatically
                            expand the scope of FaaS.</p>
