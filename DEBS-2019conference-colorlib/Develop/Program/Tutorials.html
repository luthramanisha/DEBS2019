                            I
                            have 30+ years’ experience in software engineering, compiler technology, domain languages,
                            language engineering, algebraic graph transformation, triple graph grammars and other areas.
                            I developed an enterprise modeling framework that is supporting evolving domain languages
                            using algebraic graph transformation (AGT) and using triple graph grammars (TGGs) based on
                            AGT and that, for the first time, provides support for the propagation of constraints across
                            modeling domains integrated by TGGs, and, that also provides support for horizontal
                            integration and synchronization of organizational domain models in the finance industry by
                            the help of TGGs. Other achievements are the development of business continuity processes
                            using the generative power of graph grammars, the application of TGGs in order to align the
                            syntax of a language with its semantics in a way that supports language evolution with
                            regard to the syntax and the semantics of a language artifact and, for the first time, the
                            development of an integrated compositional model encompassing syntax, semantics and
                            pragmatics as the three main dimensions of language that is able to support compositional
                            language engineering.</p>

                        <p class="justifyAlignment">In the Big Data context, data streaming systems have been introduced
                            to tame velocity and enable reactive decision making. However, approaching such systems is
                            still too complex due to the paradigm shift they require, i.e., moving from scalable batch
                            processing to continuous analysis and detection. Declarative Languages are playing a crucial
                            role in fostering the adoption of Stream Processing solutions. In this full-day tutorial, we
                            aim of introducing various approaches for declarative querying of the state-of-the-art big
                            data streaming frameworks. In addition, we provides guidelines and hand-on experience on
                            developing and deploying Stream Processing applications using a variety of SQL-like
                            languages, such as EPL, KSQL, Flink-SQL, Spark Streaming SQL, and more. In particular, the
                            goals of the tutorial are to:
                        <li>Provide the fundamental notion of processing streams with declarative languages,</li>
                        <li>Offer an overview of current challenges and state of the art for streaming query
                            languages,
                        </li>
                        <li>Showcase different technologies for processing streams, and</li>
                        <li>Outline the process of developing and deploying stream processing applications.</li>

                            Management at the Department of Electronics and Information of the Politecnico di Milano. In
                            more than 15 years of research, his research interests covered Big Data, Stream Processing,
                            Semantic technologies, Data Science, Web Information Retrieval, and Service Oriented
                            Architectures. He branded the stream reasoning research field. The semantic and syntactic
                            extensions, which he proposed to the SemanticWeb stack (i.e., RDF streams and Continuous
                            SPARQL), are currently on the path towards standardization at a W3C in the RDF Stream
                            Processing community group. His work on Stream Reasoning was applied in analyzing Social
                            Media, Mobile Telecom and IoT data streams in collaboration with Telecom Italia, IBM,
                            Siemens, Oracle, Indra, and Statoil. In 2015, he started up a company (Fluxedo) to
                            commercialize the open source results of Stream Reasoning research. His education activities
                            include lecturing on Web Science, Software Project Management, Semantic Technologies, Stream

                        <p class="justifyAlignment">Event-based systems encounter challenges of correctness and
                            consistency. Correctness means that the execution results match the intention of the
                            designer. Consistency means that different data elements that co-exist within a certain
                            system creates an internal consistency with respect to the system's requirements. In this
                            tutorial we cover the different aspects of correctness and consistency. We discuss issues of
                            correctness with respect of the temporal properties of the system, such as: order of events,
                            and boundaries of time windows. We further discuss the different aspects of fine tuning
                            required in event-based system, where different semantic interpretations are possible, such
                            as: repeating events, or consumption. The consistency discussion relates to two classic
                            issues in the data management world: data dependencies and integrity constraint enforcement.
                            Since event-based systems typically consist of loosely-coupled component architecture in
                            distributed environment, the challenge is compliance with data dependencies and assertions
                            about consistency. Last but not least, we discuss the validation of event-based systems by
                            using static and dynamic analysis.

                        <p class="justifyAlignment">Developing distributed systems is a complex task that requires to
                            program different peers, often using several languages on different platforms, writing
                            communication code and handling data serialization and conversion.
                        </p>

                        <p class="justifyAlignment">We show how the multitier programming paradigm can alleviate these
                            issues, supporting a development model where all peers in the system can be written in the
                            same language and coexist in the same compilation units, communication code is automatically
                            inserted by the compiler and the language abstracts over data conversion and serialization.
                            We present multitier programming abstractions, discuss their applicability step by step for
                            the development of small applications and discuss larger case studies on distributed stream
                            processing, like Apache Flink and Apache Gearpump.
