                            – I
                            have 30+ years’ experience in software engineering, compiler technology, domain languages,
                            language engineering, algebraic graph transformation, triple graph grammars and other areas.
                            I developed an enterprise modeling framework that is supporting evolving domain languages
                            using algebraic graph transformation (AGT) and using triple graph grammars (TGGs) based on
                            AGT and that, for the first time, provides support for the propagation of constraints across
                            modeling domains integrated by TGGs, and, that also provides support for horizontal
                            integration and synchronization of organizational domain models in the finance industry by
                            the help of TGGs. Other achievements are the development of business continuity processes
                            using the generative power of graph grammars, the application of TGGs in order to align the
                            syntax of a language with its semantics in a way that supports language evolution with
                            regard to the syntax and the semantics of a language artifact and, for the first time, the
                            development of an integrated compositional model encompassing syntax, semantics and
                            pragmatics as the three main dimensions of language that is able to support compositional
                            language engineering.</p>

                            to tame velocity and enable reactive decision making. However, approaching such systems is
                            still too complex due to the paradigm shift they require, i.e., moving from scalable batch
                            processing to continuous analysis and detection. Declarative Languages are playing a crucial
                            role in fostering the adoption of Stream Processing solutions. In this full-day tutorial, we
                            aim of introducing various approaches for declarative querying of the state-of-the-art big
                            data streaming frameworks. In addition, we provides guidelines and hand-on experience on
                            developing and deploying Stream Processing applications using a variety of SQL-like
                            languages, such as EPL, KSQL, Flink-SQL, Spark Streaming SQL, and more. In particular, the
                            goals of the tutorial are to:
                        <li>Provide the fundamental notion of processing streams with declarative languages,</li>
                        <li>Offer an overview of current challenges and state of the art for streaming query
                            languages,
                        </li>
                        <li>Showcase different technologies for processing streams, and</li>
                        <li>Outline the process of developing and deploying stream processing applications.</li>
