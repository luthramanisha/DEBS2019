                            Technology has been the key enabler of the current Big Data movement. Without open-source
                            tools like R and Spark, as well as the advent of cheap, abundant computing and storage in
                            the cloud, the trend toward datafication of almost every field in research and industry
                            could never have happened. However, the current Big Data tool set is ill-suited for
                            interactive data analytics to better involve the human-in-the-loop which makes the knowledge

                            Continuous, dynamic and short-term learning is an effective learning strategy when operating
                            in very fast and dynamic environments, where concept drift constantly occurs. In an on-line,
                            stream learning model, data arrives as a stream of sequentially ordered samples, and older
                            data is no longer available to revise earlier suboptimal modeling decisions as the fresh
                            data arrives. Learning takes place by processing a sample at a time, inspecting it only
                            once, and as such, using a limited amount of memory; stream approaches work in a limited
                            amount of time, and have the advantage to perform a prediction at any point in time during
                            the stream. In this talk I focus on a particularly challenging problem, that of continually
                            learning detection models capable to recognize cyber-attacks and system intrusions in a
                            highly dynamic environment such as the Internet. I consider adaptive learning algorithms for
                            the analysis of continuously evolving network data streams, using a dynamic, variable length
                            system memory which automatically adapts to concept drifts in the underlying data. By
                            continuously learning and detecting concept drifts to adapt memory length, I show that
                            adaptive learning algorithms can continuously realize high detection accuracy over dynamic
                            network data streams. I would additionally present other approaches leading to the continual
                            acquisition of knowledge, by extending traditional active learning schemes to the streaming
                            domain, through the application of reinforcement learning concepts. Taking a broader look
                            into the application of AI for Networking (Ai4NETS), I will conclude my talk by elaborating
                            on some of the major showstoppers hindering a natural application of machine learning in the
                            networking applied field.</p>

                            The continuing acceleration of innovation in the digital economy dramatically changes the
                            way modern companies are working. Today, enterprises are competing in a race for the best
                            technology to gain better insights into their companies, deals and processes with the goal
                            to obtain competitive advantages in the market. The winners of this race will be more than
                            ever defined by their ability to adopt newly arising technologies such as Cloud Computing,
                            Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Autonomous Systems and Advanced Analytics.
                            However, in today's fast-moving economy, new technological trends arise in a velocity and
                            variety that makes it hard even for modern companies to keep up. One of those
                            ground-breaking technological trends gaining more and more attention in research and
                            industry is machine learning, which is best described as a set of intelligent algorithms and
                            statistical models providing systems the ability to automatically gain knowledge from
                            experience. Companies utilize machine learning to take more intelligent and pro-active
                            decisions and to apply automation for repetitive tasks, ultimately allowing them to
                            transition from classical businesses to intelligent enterprises. However, despite the fact
                            that machine learning has the potential to revolutionize the industry, its comprehensive
                            adoption is still relatively low. The reason is that machine learning requires a complex
                            process before it can be used productively. It starts with extracting data from various,
                            heterogeneous sources, over unifying and transforming the data to a joint data set, towards
                            running potentially expensive training jobs. Realizing and optimizing this process
                            efficiently end-to-end in a way which is compliant to data processing regulations is a key
                            element for a successful adoption of machine learning. Hence, companies are investing huge
                            amounts of resources for building machine learning systems, including the orchestration of a
                            large zoo of individual, heterogenous tools that all realize only partial aspects of the
                            full machine learning process. In this talk, we will present SAP's approach of using
                            cloud-native, containerized development to build an efficient, distributed platform for
                            enterprise-scale end-to-end data science and machine learning.
