                        <p>Note: the main problem that occurs with submissions generated with <code>pdflatex</code>
                            is that the fonts are not embedded properly. This most often occurs
                            because vector images included from your LaTeX do not themselves embed
                            their fonts. If we find problems with your PDF, and you are unable to
                            submit a revised version with correctly embedded fonts, we may have to
                            take a less desirable and less safe route: that you submit a PostScript
                            (PS) version, from which we produce PDF.</p>

                                    templates. Therefore, please download the acmcopyright.sty from the ACM template

                                    in your copyright block. There are three different forms of copyright block. You
                                    must use the one corresponding to what you selected during the rights management

                        used to index your work.</p>

                    <h4 id="bad-breaks">Bad breaks</h4>
                    <p>Be sure you do not have bad page breaks or bad column breaks. One example of a bad column break
                        is a “widow.”</p>
                    <p>A <b>“widow”</b> occurs when the last line of a paragraph
                        that begins at the bottom of one column appears by itself at the top of
                        the next column). If this happens, tighten the previous column to bring
                        it back, or force an additional line of text over to the next column.</p>
                    <p>Also make sure that <b><em>Section and Sub-section headings</em></b> have at least two
                        lines of body text below them when they appear at the end of a page or column.</p>

                    <h4 id="third-party-material">Third party material</h4>
                    <p>In the event any element used in your material contains the work of third-parties, it is the
                        author/presenter’s responsibility to secure any necessary permissions and/or licenses, and the
                        authors will provide the same permissions in writing to the ACM. If the copyright holder
                        requires a citation to a copyrighted work, it is the authors’ responsibility to include the
                        correct wording and citations to the copyrighted material in their submissions.</p>

                    <h4 id="images-and-figures">Images and figures</h4>
                    <p>Below are some recommendations to ensure good print reproduction of
                        the images, figures, and illustrations utilized in your submission.</p>
                    <p>(a) <b>Colors and Black &amp; White (Gray Scale) Print Testing</b>.
                        If you have any images in color, please print your paper out in black
                        and white to ensure that the tones and screens used in your images or
                        figures reproduce well in black and white, too. However, your images
                        will appear in full color in any distributed electronic proceedings and
                        in the ACM digital library.</p>
                    <p>(b) <b>Resolution &amp; CMYK</b>: Figures, charts, and
                        diagrams should use a vector image format (e.g. PDF, SVG). Raster images
                        (e.g. photographs) should be at least 300 or 600 dpi for quality
                        reproduction and saved as .tif images (or other compatible formats that
                        support print-quality resolution). When creating or revising your images
                        for inclusion in the paper, we recommend choosing CMYK (and not RGB) as
                        the color profile.</p>
                    <p>(c) <b>TIFF/PNG versus JPG (JPEG) images</b>: For raster
                        images (e.g. photos), TIFFs are preferred for press applications where
                        quality takes priority over file size. When TIFFs are compressed (using
                        LZW compression option when saving from Adobe Photoshop, for example),
                        no image data is lost, thus ensuring maximum quality. A JPEG is a
                        compressed image format designed to keep the file size small, which
                        makes it ideal for use in web graphics. However, to achieve this, the
                        JPEG format actually removes precision from the image. This is referred
                        to as a lossy compression system. On a printout, the removed data tends
                        to show up as blocky areas of a solid color, or ghosting near
                        high-contrast changes. At higher print resolutions (a minimum of 200
                        dpi), there’s usually enough data in the JPEG file for the compression
                        artefacts to be very noticeable.</p>
                    <p>(d) <b>Rules/Lines</b>: Rules used in your graphs, tables
                        or charts must be at least 0.5 point in stroke and black for quality
                        reproduction. Finer lines and points than this will not reproduce well,
                        even if you can see them on your laser printed hardcopy when checked —
                        your laser printers will usually have a far lower resolution than the
                        imagesetters that will be used.</p>
                    <p>(e) <b>Fonts</b>: If your figure uses custom or any
                        non-standard font, the characters may appear differently when printed in
                        the proceedings. Remember to check your figure creation to ensure that
                        all fonts are embedded or included in the figure correctly. <em>Be sure that your images do not
                            contain any Type 3 fonts</em>.</p>
                    <p>(f) <b>Transparency</b>: If a figure or image is assembled
                        from multiple images, the images must be embedded, and layers be
                        flattened or grouped together properly in the file. Transparency <b>must</b> be
                        flattened.</p>

                    <h4 id="page-numbering-headers-and-footers">Page numbering, headers, and footers</h4>
                    <p>Your final submission <b>MUST NOT</b> contain any footer or
                        header string information at the top or bottom of each page, nor any
                        page numbering. The submissions will be paginated in a determined order
                        by the chairs and page numbers added to the PDF during the compiling,
                        indexing, and pagination process.</p>

                    <h4 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h4>
                    <p>It is the contact or submitting author’s responsibility to be sure that any funding or special
                        contribution acknowledgements are included in the final version submitted as required by any
                        research, financial, or other grants received (by using the “Acknowledgements” section before
                        the References section).

                    <h3 class="mb-30">Submitting the Required Files</h3>

                    <p>When your final version is ready, you need to upload your PDF file using EasyChair. Please try to
                        submit once, rather than submitting many drafts of your final version.</p>
                    <p>Alongside your PDF file, <b>you will be required to submit the source files for your paper</b> –
                        all files which were used to create the final output (PDF), be they Word, LaTeX, image files,
                        etc. Please create a single .zip folder containing all the source files used to create the final
                        PDF and name it "firstauthorname.zip". </p>

                    <p>As an accepted author, you have access to the proceedings section of EasyChair.</p>

                    <p>You will see a confirmation screen after a successful upload to EasyChair. Also, a confirmation
                        email will be sent to the contact’s email address entered on the submission page.</p>

                    <p>If changes are needed, you will be contacted by one of the publication coordinators in case you
                        need to fix something. If this is true, you will receive specific information about how to
                        revise your submission to meet requirements, and a new deadline will be given to submit the
                        corrected material. You are required by the chairs to adhere to this NEW deadline so publication
                        is not delayed.</p>
