                                    version with correctly embedded fonts, we may have to take a less desirable and less

                                <p class="justifyAlignment">Be sure you do not have bad page breaks or bad column
                                    breaks. One example of a bad column break is a widow, which occurs when the last
                                    line of a paragraph that begins at the bottom of one column appears by itself at the
                                    top of the next column). If this happens, tighten the previous column to bring it
                                    back, or force an additional line of text over to the next column. </p>
                                <p class="justifyAlignment">Also make sure that Section and Sub-section headings have at
                                    least two lines of body text below them when they appear at the end of a page or
                                    column. </p>

                                <h4 class="mb-20">Third party material</h4>

                                <p class="justifyAlignment">In the event any element used in your material contains the
                                    work of third-parties, it is the author/presenter’s responsibility to secure any
                                    necessary permissions and/or licenses, and the authors will provide the same
                                    permissions in writing to the ACM. If the copyright holder requires a citation to a
                                    copyrighted work, it is the authors’ responsibility to include the correct wording
                                    and citations to the copyrighted material in their submissions. </p>

                                <h4 class="mb-20">Images and figures</h4>

                                <p class="justifyAlignment">Below are some recommendations to ensure good print
                                    reproduction of the images, figures, and illustrations utilized in your
                                    submission. </p>
                                <li><b>Colors and Black & White (Gray Scale) Print Testing.</b> If you have any images
                                    in color, please print your paper out in black and white to ensure that the tones
                                    and screens used in your images or figures reproduce well in black and white, too.
                                    However, your images will appear in full color in any distributed electronic
                                    proceedings and in the ACM digital library.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Resolution & CMYK.</b> Figures, charts, and diagrams should use a vector image
                                    format (e.g. PDF, SVG). Raster images (e.g. photographs) should be at least 300 or
                                    600 dpi for quality reproduction and saved as .tiff images (or other compatible
                                    formats that support print-quality resolution). When creating or revising your
                                    images for inclusion in the paper, we recommend choosing CMYK (and not RGB) as the
                                    color profile.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>TIFF/PNG versus JPG (JPEG) image.</b> For raster images (e.g. photos), TIFFs are
                                    preferred for press applications where quality takes priority over file size. When
                                    TIFFs are compressed (using LZW compression option when saving from Adobe Photoshop,
                                    for example), no image data is lost, thus ensuring maximum quality. A JPEG is a
                                    compressed image format designed to keep the file size small, which makes it ideal
                                    for use in web graphics. However, to achieve this, the JPEG format actually removes
                                    precision from the image. This is referred to as a lossy compression system. On a
                                    printout, the removed data tends to show up as blocky areas of a solid color, or
                                    ghosting near high-contrast changes. At higher print resolutions (a minimum of 200
                                    dpi), there’s usually enough data in the JPEG file for the compression artefacts to
                                    be very noticeable.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Rules/Lines.</b> Rules used in your graphs, tables or charts must be at least 0.5
                                    point in stroke and black for quality reproduction. Finer lines and points than this
                                    will not reproduce well, even if you can see them on your laser printed hardcopy
                                    when checked — your laser printers will usually have a far lower resolution than the
                                    imagesetters that will be used.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Fonts.</b> If your figure uses custom or any non-standard font, the characters
                                    may appear differently when printed in the proceedings. Remember to check your
                                    figure creation to ensure that all fonts are embedded or included in the figure
                                    correctly. Be sure that your images do not contain any Type 3 fonts.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Transparency.</b> If a figure or image is assembled from multiple images, the
                                    images must be embedded, and layers be flattened or grouped together properly in the
                                    file. Transparency <b>must</b> be flattened.
                                </li>
